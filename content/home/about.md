# Biography

I am an undergraduate student pursuing Computer Science and Engineering from [NIT Trichy](https://www.nitt.edu). I am keenly focussed on the enticing research areas of Computer Science such as machine learning, deep learning and computer vision. Recently, I worked under [Prof C. V. Jawahar](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/) at the [CVIT lab] (http://cvit.iiit.ac.in/), [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/) on Indian Flora Project: Social Image Data Based Plant Species Identification and Disease Detection. I am also a recipient of the Indian Academy of Sciences' Summer Research Fellowship.

I am a machine learning enthusiast and web developer at [Spider, the R&D Club of NIT Trichy](https://spider.nitt.edu) and a strong supporter of the open-source community. I have participated in several hackathons and have worked on several web-related projects both in the academia as well as the industry.

I love to organize events, lead and work as a team with a diverse set of people. I have held multiple key positions in a wide variety of clubs and teams ranging from cultural, technical to marketing roles. I am an ambivert and a musicophile. I also spend my leisure time by reading and writing articles, appreciating good music and humour. I also care for educational and social rights.
