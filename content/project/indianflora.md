* The full project report can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hhzZYk9c4zbqJtzZ46NwfAZz0b-7W56j/view?usp=sharing).
* Employed Convolutional Neural Network model (ResNet18) by iterating through several different models
trained from-the-scratch, fine-tuned on ImageNet, PlantCLEF Encyclopedia of Life, PlantCLEF noisy web
datasets on a manually collected, robust dataset of 100 Indian plant species. (using PyTorch)
* Experimental observations show efficient computation time and high top-5 precision of 99.85% compared to
the low performance of state-of-the-art approaches that focus on hand-engineered features.
* Deployed a collaborative web-portal using Angular and NodeJS and an Android mobile application where
users can add new observations to the catalogue and query for species identification.
* *The research was supported by the Indian Academy of Sciencesâ€™ Summer Research Fellowship.*
