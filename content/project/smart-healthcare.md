* A collaborative pipeline between doctors and patients.

* Android application was developed for the patients to view their medical health record, add trusted doctors and digitize the medical checkup they undertake with their trusted doctors.

* A web-portal was developed for the registered practitioners to view the health record of their trusted patients, add checkup details, prescribed medicines and other important scan documents.

* Wrote APIs for the Android application where the features were deployed.

* The system was made foolproof with the help of Aadhaar authentication.

* Implemented deep learning models to predict disease risks based on user symptoms and lifestyle inputs.

* Used web-scraped data for training the model.

* Built a recommendation system for analyzing the abnormal parameters and recommending future course of
action like medicines and treatment.

* *This project was done as a part of the Pragyan Hackathon conducted at SAP Labs, Bangalore.*
